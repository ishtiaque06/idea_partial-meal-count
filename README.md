# Partial Meal Counter
An Android app that sends you notifications occasionally asking whether you've swiped a meal, and keeps track of your meal plan stats automatically. 

## Rationale
As a college student on a partial meal plan, I have to regularly keep track of how many meals I'm swiping in at my college's dining facility. Rather than manually checking how many meals I have left, I am making this app, which automates the process and updates the number of meals you have automatically. 

### Database for Multi-platform Access
This repository will be an accompanying a tutorial that shows new Android developers how to make basic database tables with Firebase and use it to construct an Android app based on that data online.

### Basic Functionality
The app will let users sign in and sign out. For each user, it's going to store the meals they had swiped so far in the semester. Periodically throughout the day, it's going to send notifications to the user asking wehther they swiped in since the last time they had swiped in. If they press Yes, then the data will be updated. Users can also just open the app and manually edit the amount of meals they have left so far. 

At the end of the semester, they will receive a notification that asks them to update their meal plan if necessary.
